			<h1>IoT Workshop</h1>
			<p>Greetings from Team SPEC.<br>
			<p>If you think that the internet has changed your life, think again?
			The Internet of Things is about to change it all over again !<br>
			<span>Team SPEC</span> is going to conduct a workshop on <span>Internet of Things</span> - which refers to physical connection of billions of devices to the internet
			which can collect and share data to make our day to day lives simpler.<br>
			The workshop will enable the participants in learning the fundamental concepts of IoT and it's various applications in solving a wide range of engineering problems
			from Home Automation to Self - Driving Cars.<br>
			It will teach how to access your NodeMCU via Blynk app and IFTTT, accessing sensor like
			DHT, Ultrasonic over internet.
			Thus you will become well-versed with one of the most trending topics in engineering world and can start building your own projects.

			<h1> Doodle: Data Science and Machine Learning Workshop</h1>
			<span>Greeting everyone Team SPEC is organising a workshop on "Data Science and Machine Learning ".<br></span>
			<p>Data Science  and  Machine Learning is a growing field that is used when searching the web, placing ads, credit scoring, stock trading and for many other applications.<br><p>
			<span>This data science workshop  is an introduction to machine learning and algorithms.<span>
			<p> You will develop a basic understanding of the principles of machine learning and derive practical solutions using predictive analytics. We will also examine why algorithms play an essential role in Big Data analysis.<br>
			<br>To handle and analyze extremely large datasets using cutting edge open source tools and sophisticated data analysis algorithms, one has to be properly trained in Data Science.<br>
			Don't miss this opportunity as the knowledge and expertise of the skills is an added advantage for a better and competitive career<br>

			<h1>C Programming Workshop</h1>
			<p>Greetings everyone, <span>Team Spec</span> is presenting a workshop on <span>C - A platform to learn and built your logics.</span><br>
Although numerous computer languages are used for writing computer applications, the computer programming language, C, is the most popular language worldwide. Everything from microcontrollers to operating systems is written in C since it’s very flexible and versatile, allowing maximum control with minimal commands.
If you are interested in a career in computer programming, it would be wise to start by learning the C as your first programming language.<br>
It will help build your logic development, understand concept of data structures, pointers, loops etc. Once learnt, C acts as a base from which you can move
onto other programminglanguages.
<ul>
	<li>Header Files, Identifiers, Constants, Data Types</li>
	<li>Operators, Types of Conversions</li>
	<li>Conditional Statements and Loops</li>
	<li>Arrays, Functions, Recursion</li>
	<li>Strings and Pointers</li>
	</ul><p>

				<h1>Gate Simulation</h1>
				<p>Hello freshers,Hope everyone is still in that energetic mode to learn and explore more about electronics culture.<br>
					Still confused with field of electronics?<br>
					Don't worry .... <span>Team SPEC</span> is here  with it's very first open -for -all workshop  on "Gate Simulation "--a logic to gate building and circuit designing intending to familiarize students with basic electronics along with a talk on career options available to you.
	This is going to be a interactive session covering all the topics such as --<br>
	<ol>
		<li>Introduction to Logic Gates network with implementation .</li>
		<li>Breadboard working.</li>
		<li>PCB layout using Proteus software.</li>
		<li>Circuit designing and fabrication.</li>
	</ol>
	 The Proteus Design Suite is a proprietary software tool suite used primarily for electronic design automation. The software is used mainly by electronic design engineers and technicians to create schematics and electronic prints for manufacturing printed circuit boards.<br>
	Here,we will also demonstrate you some of projects and technologies which we have worked on to inspire you all to be future engineers.<br>
